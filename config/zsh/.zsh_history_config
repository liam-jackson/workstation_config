# or set a custom format using the strftime function format specifications,

setopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY

# Append new history lines, clear the history list, re-read the history list, print prompt.
# Note: history management is automatically handled in Zsh so we don't need an equivalent for PROMPT_COMMAND
# However, you could use the precmd hook for similar functionality if needed.
